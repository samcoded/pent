## ABOUT

Pent is a hypothetical platform where users can sign up with their basic information and post reviews about apartments they have previously lived in. These reviews can include optional videos and/or images. The users can give reviews about the landlords, the environment the apartment is situated, and the quality of amenities in the apartment.
